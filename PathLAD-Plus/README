This is a solver for solving subgraph isomorphism problems.
Our work is accepted by IJCAI2023 and our improvement is based on the PathLAD solver,

Usage
-----

  -p FILE  Input pattern graph (mandatory)
  -t FILE  Input target graph (mandatory)
  -s INT   Set CPU time limit in seconds (default: 60)
  -f       Stop at first solution (default: search for all solutions)
  -v       Print solutions (default: only number of solutions)
  -h       Print this help message

Graph format
------------

Pattern and target graphs should be defined in two text files. The format of these files is defined as follows:
- The first line only contains the number n of vertices.
- Each following line gives, for each vertex i, the number of successors of i followed by the list of successors of i.
- Nodes must be numbered from 0 and, if there is an edge from i to j and an edge from j to i, then j must be a successor of i and i must be a successor of j.
